# Web applications
## Internet
Internet is worldwide system of connected computers what can store and transfer and process information. This network have next characteristics:
- computers here is logically connected with unique addresses, what are based on internet protocol (IP)
- Computers can comunicate with each other using **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) or **Internet protocol** (IP)
- Network provides hight level services for privat or public use
==WWW (World Wide Web)== – distributed system what provides acces to documents stored on different computers connected to the internet. WWW is not the internet but it is a part of it.
## Website
Webside is a foundation of modern internet. 
==Website== – one or more web pages what is connected by links one with other, united by subject and located at the same address. 
==Web-page== – text document written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
==Domain name== – unique charset string of text what contains letters and numbers and can be as long as needet. It is usefull for users to remember and share address of web site
==Hosting== – preconfigured server what stores files and have specific software to work with requests.
==Content== – any information availible on website
### Website naming and addressign
In 1990 Douglas Carl Engelbart proposed way to set unique address of each element of the web. This way became a URI in the future web.
**URI (Unique Resource Identifier)** – internet standart what defines and describes of main components involved in naming of the site. 
**Resource** – device or bit of information what can be accesed remotely
This Identifier allow to specify location of every bit of information on the web. It can be image, text, video or another file type. URI contains URL and URN 

> URI = URL + URN

**URL (Unique resource location)** – adress or address system of resource on the internet. URL determins location of resource and allow to acces it.
**URN (Unique resource Name)** – constant character set what defines enique name of resource in global web. URN defindes only name of specific resource what can be find in many specific places.
### URI and Domain
To easier navigation throughtout the web was introduced domain. On the base level servers works with sets of three numbers separated by dots. But it is hard to use so domains is more commonly used.
Domain have parts separated by dots, what helps to have domain structure. Domain is separated to levels, what is counting from right to left,  and form **Fully Qualifyed Domain Name (FQDN)**
**Zero level domain** – root domain what have no name and mostly hidden from user, it is always presented in the domain
**First level domain** – it is part of the domain what is right after last dot. It is part of domain what can't be chaged by user because list of top (first) level domains is defined and approved by ICANN
**Second level domain** – second level domain what is also called parent or main.
**Third level domain** – last part of the domain what is used to represent section of the site. The most comminly used third level domain is www, what is very often hidden from users.
#### First level domains types
##### Generic 
Generic domains often is used to say what type of site is
- .com – site of company
- .org – site of non comertial organization
- .post – site of postal service
- .edu – eudcational portla
This domains can be registred legaly by any user or entity on the web
##### Country
This first level domains specify country of web site. Some countries allows only their citisenz to use this domains. This tipe of first level domins is more hard to get.
- ua – Ukraine
- us – USA
- cn – China
### URL, Domain name, DNS and IP
Every site on the web have specific addres what is set of numbers. It represents a real sercer where website is stored. This IP addresses is hard to remembering and typing, so in 1980s was created **Domain Name System (DNS)**. With help of it every ip can be converted ito alphabetic name (domain) understandeble for users. Domain names are fast shortcuts to the server hosting site.
## Web browser
Web browser have a set of modules used to make web browsing expirience possible. Here list of main components
- **User interface** – part of the web browser with what users  works
- **Browser engine** – part of the web browser used to make integration between the interface and display module
- **Display module (rendering engine)** – part of the web browser used to render web pages and display thay on screen.
- **Network components** – execute network calls
- **Ineterpreter of Java script** –  executes parsing and JavaScript code execution.
- **UI backend** – used to draw pop ups, comboboxes and checkboxes.
- **Data storage** – store the information about processes

# Structure of the first project
## File types
The most common files in front-end projects are 
- .htmp 
- .css 
- .js 
### .html
**HTML (HyperText Mackup Language) file** – plaine text file with .html extension, what provides structure of the webpage. Interact with file webenjine what can draw text, headngs, lists tables images and videos. Commonly used to create static websites.
### .css
**.css (Cascade Style Sheet) file** – file what contains descriptions of  style of different elements on web page.
### .js
**.js (Java Script) file** – used to add interaction to the site. For example – pop-up  windows, getting and proccesing of user data

## Image formats
### JPEG
**JPEG (JPG)** – one of the best files for photos. Have nice image compressing and rich collor pallet. Allow to speed up loading of the web page, but not support transparent background what means that this type of graphic can't be overlap with another components of web page
### GIF
**GIF** – used to store images with crisp horders and sharp edges between colors. This file format supports only 256 collors and allow one of them be transparent. Also gifs supports simple animations 
### SVG
**SVG** – vector graphic type what contains each element individually, and supports element animation. This type file can be edditet in graphic programs and text editors and be infinitely scalable. Also it is very light, what means that it can speed up site loading procces.
### PNG
**PNGs** exist in two formats – **PNG8** and **PNG24**
#### PNG8
**PNG8** images contains only 256 collor one of it can be transparrent or half transparent what. Also this formats compress images without data loses and in smaller sizes than GIF
#### PNG24 
**PNG24** is the same as PNG8 but can store unlimited number of collors, but is heavyer than **JPEG**. Should be used when quality is esential and file size – not.
## Video formats
Currently HTML5 supports three video formats – **MP4**,  **OGG** and **WEBM**
### MP4
**MP4** is video imapge type, part of MPEG4 specification. Provides great video qualiry and can contain subtitles, audio and video.
### WEBM
**WEBM** files is video file format what can be easoly extracted without hight computing power. Used in streaming sevices. Contains only video and audio
### OGG
**OGG** files is free file format and can contain video audio and another data.
>[!TIP]
>Separating of HTML, CSS and JS files make your code more structured, reusable and understandable for coleques
## Methods of adding resources to HTML
### Emneding files into HTML
To add file to HTML file we shout set file path in it. File pathes can be absolute or relative. For more easee use all project files should be in one folder.
#### Absolute file pathes
This way of file path definding used when resource located on another website. In one site absolute pathes mostly unuse. Main reason of it is very combersome and can all file links can be brocken if site change its URL
#### Root relative file path
**Root relative path** – shows file location in relation to site root directory. Address starts with slash and poits to root root of the site. Used when working on web servers and if document will moved to another location – link still work.
#### Relative path for file location
**Relative path for file location** – shows file location in relation to current file. Uses dots to show current directory and two dots to go one level of file eararchy up. Used when site is developing on personal computer
### Embeding resourches into HTML
There are two ways to embed resources in an HTML – embeding section and embeding resource
#### Spliting into files
This way of embading  means than link to whole resource is embedet to html file. This means than after endidng of loading html file browser start downloading whole resource. It can significantly slow down page loading. Recomendet to embed only small and very important resources in this way.

#### Embeding resource
The main idea here is to write small pieces of CSS or JS code directly inside html file using 
`<style> </style>` and `<script></script>` responively. When script or style file is big – better practice is to write this parts of code in separated files, but in another cases – it can be included directly in html. 
## FIle structure
### Grouping files by type
Suitable for small project

### Grouping files by module
Suitable for complex project edited by group of developers

## File naming guidelines
1. Name file with small letters
2. Avoid spaces
3. Don't use `_` use `-` instead
4. Special symbols in file names is illigal in different operating systems – avoid using it
