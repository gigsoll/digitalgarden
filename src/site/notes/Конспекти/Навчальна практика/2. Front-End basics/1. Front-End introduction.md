## Website naming and addressign
In 1990 Douglas Carl Engelbart proposed way to set unique address of each element of the web. This way became a URI in the future web.
**URI (Unique Resource Identifier)** – internet standart what defines and describes of main components involved in naming of the site. 
**Resource** – device or bit of information what can be accesed remotely
This Identifier allow to specify location of every bit of information on the web. It can be image, text, video or another file type. URI contains URL and URN 

> URI = URL + URN

**URL (Unique resource location)** – adress or address system of resource on the internet. URL determins location of resource and allow to acces it.
**URN (Unique resource Name)** – constant character set what defines enique name of resource in global web. URN defindes only name of specific resource what can be find in many specific places.
## URI and Domain
To easier navigation throughtout the web was introduced domain. On the base level servers works with sets of three numbers separated by dots. But it is hard to use so domains is more commonly used.
Domain have parts separated by dots, what helps to have domain structure. Domain is separated to levels, what is counting from right to left,  and form **Fully Qualifyed Domain Name (FQDN)**
**Zero level domain** – root domain what have no name and mostly hidden from user, it is always presented in the domain
**First level domain** – it is part of the domain what is right after last dot. It is part of domain what can't be chaged by user because list of top (first) level domains is defined and approved by ICANN
**Second level domain** – second level domain what is also called parent or main.
**Third level domain** – last part of the domain what is used to represent section of the site. The most comminly used third level domain is www, what is very often hidden from users.
### First level domains types

#### Country
This first level domains specify country of web site. Some countries allows only their citisenz to use this domains. This tipe of first level domins is more hard to get.
- ua – Ukraine
- us – USA

## URL, Domain name, DNS and IP
Every site on the web have specific addres what is set of numbers. It represents a real sercer where website is stored. This IP addresses is hard to remembering and typing, so in 1980s was created **Domain Name System (DNS)**. With help of it every ip can be converted ito alphabetic name (domain) understandeble for users. Domain names are fast shortcuts to the server hosting site.
# Web browser
