## Creation of tag

</div>
```

**Tag atributes** are used to give tags additional properties and discribe its rendering on a web page. Atributes contains additional information what can be readen by a web browser
Atributes is writen inside of tag opening and if it is multiple atributes – it is separated by spaces.
```html
<div class="className"></div>
```
**Single tags** have all the same but excluding tag closing
```html
<img src="path/to/image" alt="label of the image">
```
Every tag is unique and can not be repeated multile times on one tag. For example src is ok but double src in one img tag doesn't work

```html
This tag <audio src='audio/music.mp3' controls> adds audio to the page </audio>
