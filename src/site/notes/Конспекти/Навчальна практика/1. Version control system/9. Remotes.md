On the practice when developers uses git they have two repositories â€“ local and remote one. This structure help to syncronize work between different developers and also have backup of work. 
# Add remote
```sh
git remote add [name] [url]
```
# List remotes
```sh
git remote -v
```
# Delete remote
```sh
git remote remove [name]
```
