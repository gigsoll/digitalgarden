# Main goals of version control systems
1. Backup and restore
2. Syncronization
3. Undo
4. Track changes and ownerships
5. Sandboxing
6. Branching

# Version contol system types

## By mechanism of work with file changes
### 1. Lock-modify-unclock 
Developer lock file and edit it itself. After all changes it commit file to the server and unlock it. After this file unlocks on the server and another developer can edit it. Another developer can lock file, update its local files and start work on it

### 2. Copy-modify-merge
Developers has no abilities to lock files for another developers. First developer downloads version from server and create or edit files on its machine. After it he commit it to the server. If files have no conflicts they updates on the server. If files have some conflicts (for example version of one developer is oudated because another add his changes erlear) developer should solve the file conflict. He pulls latest version from the server. He gets file with latest version from the server and under it his own code. And on this stage he desides how to solve file conflicts. He somehow solve conflict and after this comit it to the server

## By mechanism of work on the server side
### Centralized

### Distributed

Distributed system is more complicated but they works significantly faster than Centralized system. They are much easear for server to handle becouse remove work from server. Also this method makes all system more stable and secure, because in critical situation everyone can become a server without additional setup.

# Git version control system
Git is fast, open source comand line based version control system. It is widely used by brofessional developers and big companies. It creates file snapshots and store asign specific sha1 key to they. It helps to have unig id of the project for roll back or thack changes and ownership. Also git allow create different branches and merge it together. It helps to create different strategys and methods of work organization.
