# Objects
All git commits creates objects inside of this folder and stores here.
## Git have three fundemental object types:
- tree
- commit
- BLOB – Binary Large OBject – the minimum piece of information in git
### Tree
**Tree** objects are objects what contain structure of file system (name of directarys and files). This type of object does not containes actual data of objects, it just have a structure. 
### BLOB
**BLOB** ontains data of objects. each file creates BLOB what is linked to the tree. One BLOB can be connected to more than 1 tree.
### Commit
**Commit** unite this two objects into one and it is create commit. Each commit references to previous commit (first commit refferences to NULL).
## Commands to get info
### git show
```sh
git show -s --pretty=raw [first symbols of sha1 of commit]
```
