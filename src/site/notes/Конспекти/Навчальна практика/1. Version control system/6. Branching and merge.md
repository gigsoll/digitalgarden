Git is graph based structure. Every commit is linked to previous. More correct form actually is – every new commit references previous one. Git also can create branches what can go from. The most basic understanding what git branches are – it is nature tree what can have main body and multiple branches going from it. 
Branchas in git creates when two or more commits references the same ancestor. Like on the image bellow. Here Commits B and F have the same Ancestor – commit A.

Creation of new branch called **Branching**. Opposite operation – where we connect new branch with upstream called **Merging**.
# Create new branch 
It can be created with command `git checkout` with `-b` flag
```sh
git checkout -b [branch name]
```
After cheating of new branch git swith user to it
# Switch to the branch
To switch between branches command `git checkout` without any flags is nececary
```sh
git checkout [branch name]
```
# Merging
## Fast-forwards merge
### How it works
Git has system of HEAD pointers. On every branch HEAD points last created commit. Fast-forward merge appears when we move HEAF from  last commit on the master branch to the last commit on the new branch, like on image bellow

### Performing of operation
1. Go to the branch to which should happen merge using `git checkout`
2. Run command `git merge`
```sh
git merge [name of branch what should be merged]
```
## Non fast-forwards merge
### How it works
In situations when on main branch and child branch both happends commits we can't just do fast-forwards merge, because information from commits what was created after branching on main branch will be losed. To awoid it we should use non fast-forwards merge. The main idea of this merge type is than we create a new commit what combines all changes from main and from child branch. This saves changes from both branches.

### Performing of operation
1. Switch active branch to one what is main
2. Megre changes with `git merge`
3. Commit merge using `git commit`

After all of this operation we can see this graph of history in `gitk`

# Conflict solving
In proces of  working with differend branches, file conflicts can appear. They happens when the same file was edited on both branches and git doesn't know what changes is correct and what – not.
## Avoid conflicts
- Often commits
- Do not edit line brakes, tabs and spaces
- Often merge
## Solve conflicts
### Undo merge
``` sh
git merge --abort
```
### Resolve by chosing version
#### Accepting only my changes
```sh
git checkout --Xours
```
#### Accepting only changes maded by another users
```sh
git checkout --Xtheirs
```
### Resolve manually
```sh
git diff
```
### Undo merge
```sh
git revert [sha1 of previous step]
```
# Rebase
Rebase operation change base of child branch to another commit of the main branch
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Never rebase big branches. Only small branches what is used by 1 or 2 developers can be rebased. Rebasing of big braches can corupt history of changes in another developers.
# Chery-pick
Chery-pick copy some commit from any branch into another branch without rebase
