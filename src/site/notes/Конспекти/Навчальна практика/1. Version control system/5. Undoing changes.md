# Undo files what wasn't added to index and commited
## In single file
To check what files is modified we can use command `git status`

To undo changes what isn't addet to index we should use `git checkout`
```sh
git checkout -- [filename]
```
## In root directory
To perform this operation we also should use git checkout but instead of particular file name use full stop.
```sh
git checkout -- .
```
## Only new files
Also we have another wariant of reverting changes. The main difference between reverting changes of already existing files and in new ones is than git does not have any previous versions to roll back. So we should use another comand. It is `git clean` command. To revert only new files we can use next command. 
```sh
git clean -xdf
```
It have many different parameters. 
- -x — ingnore .gitignore files
- -d — remove new directories
- - f — force (without this parameter nothing happends)
# Undo changes addet to index
First method is to unstage file (remove it from index). It can be done with gitui simply by moving it from stage to unstage area or by typing
```sh
git reset -- [filename]
```
And after this revert changes like it was in previous puncts. 
# Roll back commit
## Add content to previous commit without  creating new one
```sh
git commit --amend -m "commit message"
```
Also it can be done using git gui by checking `Amend Last Commit` checkbox.

## Complitely remove commit
To **reset commit** you should use command `git reset` with HEAD 
```sh
git reset HEAD~[number of commits to reset]
```
# Undo changes what was pushed to remote
To perform this operation we should use `git revert`
```sh
git revert [sha1 of commit]
```

# .gitignore
