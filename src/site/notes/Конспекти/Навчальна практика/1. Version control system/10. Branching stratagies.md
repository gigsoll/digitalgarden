# Centalized stratagie
In this stratagies all works in single branch. It is simple to understanding and can be used by comands what is not familliar with branching concept
# Feature-branch workflwo
This type of stradagie means that every feature should be developed in different branches. Branches can be created from master branch or from different another feature branch.

Git flow is a stratage where for different tasks is reserved specific branch. 
# Integration manager stratagy

Here we have **blessed** repository. Only user with sertant previlages can push to this repository from **Integration manager** repository. Developers pull code from **blessed** repository to **developer private** repository, make changes and after it push changes into **developer public** repo. From this repos code sends to integration managers who check code to prove than it is good enouf to be pushed to **blest** repository. It helps to make all code  work good together without additional comunication between developers.
# Dictator and leutenants stratagy
This stratagy is used in large open source projects and is very simmilar to Integration leader stratagy.

The main difference here in comparacing with integration leader stratagy is than here is more than one Integration managers, and they have different priviligies. **Lieuthenants** repos gets code from developwe repositories and looks how this code work, checks the history and send it to the **dictator** – manin integration manager. he looks to code sended by all of the his **liethenants** and if this code is good he sent it to the **blessed** repository.
# Forcking stratagie
This stratagie is comonly used on github and helps to original developer to implement changes maked by another developers without giving them write permitions on the repo.

Here third party developers creates fork of repository and make theyer changes on this fork. After some work, when all is done – they creates pull request to original developer with all of changes. Original developer checks all work maded by this developers and add it to own repo if all is OK. Number of forks on github is not limited and give to the original dev any responsibility.
